# srapping_sample
"Web scraping basically parses your HTML document in detail, extracting whatever information you desire from a web page.
For example, from a news website, we can extract news articles, reviews, and topics, which can later be analyzed accordingly.

Remember one thing while scraping is that it requires multiple requests to the web page. 
So, if a singular IP address sends requests again and again to the website, it may get temporarily blocked. 
Therefore, one should remember to use proxy IPs for scraping whenever they are doing it.

Also, while scraping, one should know the proper classes and tags of the HTML web page to ensure it works properly."
